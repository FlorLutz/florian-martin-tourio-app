# 6th Spiced Project

## Description
This was the sixth and second to last project of the spiced full-stack bootcamp. It was a group-project, in which my colleage, Mart√≠n, and I created an application using NextJS and MongoDB to view, create, delete and comment on tourist attractions.

## Key Learnings
- using MongoDB and mongoose for CRUD methods with database
- reusing and adapting react components like a form for creation and editing attractions
- implementing logics of a comment section

## Additional info
The design is very basic, since we focused on the database connection and a maximum of functionality in the very short time provided.
